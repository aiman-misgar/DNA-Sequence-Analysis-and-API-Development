This server is designed to assist forensic researchers in analyzing and comparing DNA sequences from ancient remains. It allows users to upload ancient sample data, generate DNA sequences using a specialized function, compare the genetic similarity between samples, and ask natural language questions about its features.

The API offers four main endpoints:

/upload-csv/ – Upload a CSV file with ancient remains data (id, region, age, seed).

/generate-sequence/ – Generate a DNA sequence for a sample using its unique ID.

/compare-sequences/ – Compare the DNA sequences of two samples and receive a similarity score.

/ask-me-anything/ – Ask natural language questions to understand the server’s functionality and how to use it.


You can upload a CSV file that contains records of ancient remains. Each row should include:

id: a unique sample identifier (e.g., "id_0001")

region: the region where the remain was found

age: the age of the sample (in decades)

seed: a string seed used to generate its DNA sequence


 In summary this APi offers the following functionalities:

 
1. Upload and Process Data:
   Users can upload a CSV file containing ancient samples with fields like `id`, `region`, `age`, and `seed`.

2. DNA Sequence Generation:
   The server uses a costly function to generate a DNA sequence from a sample’s attributes (`id`, `region`, `age`, `seed`).

3. DNA Comparison:
   Users can compare the DNA sequences of two samples using their IDs. The system uses local alignment (Smith-Waterman algorithm) to compute a similarity score based on matching motifs in the sequences.
